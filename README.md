# ogliore_project

ogliore.py contains functions for simulating a thermal ionization mass spectrometer analysis of two isotopes, and the statistical effects which can result from having a low, non-zero number of counts for the denominator species in an isotope ratio.

The beam intensity can be set to decay exponentially or to remain constant.
